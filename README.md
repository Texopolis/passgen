WELCOME!

This is a simple random password generator that produces a random password based on a 77 digit verifiable random string returned from the Ethereum blockchain.

The app is free to use and only requires that Metamask or other suitable web3 wallet/browser extension is installed.

It is possible that buttons will appear to be disabled but once the blocks have finished writing behind the scene and everything is resolved, the button will become usable- a few seconds of patience will resolve any of these issues.

Currently the app is working off a contract deployed to the Kovan testnet (make sure to set Metamask to point to the correct testnet) and test Eth can be found [here](https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet)

Please feel free to give feedback or comments!
