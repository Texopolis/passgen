WELCOME!

This is a simple random password generator that produces a random password based on a 77 digit verifiable random string returned from the Ethereum blockchain.

The app is free to use and only requires that Metamask or other suitable web3 wallet/browser extension is installed.

Currently the app is working off a contract deployed to the Kovan testnet (make sure to set Metamask to point to the correct testnet) and test Eth can be found [here](https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet)

Please feel free to give feedback or comments!
